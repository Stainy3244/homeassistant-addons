# 🏠 Home Assistant Add-ons Repository

Welcome to my collection of custom Home Assistant add-ons! This is a personal project where I'm developing and maintaining add-ons for my Home Assistant system. I'm sharing in the event anyone else find it useful.

## 📦 Current Add-ons

### Dispatcharr
My first add-on - currently working for my needs and only be updated with upstream changes.

## 🚧 Project Status

This repository is in its early stages. I'm just starting out with Home Assistant add-on development, so:

- ⚠️ **Expect some rough edges** - There may be bugs, incomplete features, or areas for improvement
- 📈 **Growing collection** - I plan to expand this repository with more add-ons over time
- 🧪 **Testing ground** - Consider these add-ons as beta/experimental for now

### 🤖 A Note on Development

Full transparency: I'm not a coder by trade. These add-ons have been developed with significant assistance from AI tools, combined with a healthy dose of trial, error, and frustration. What you see here is the result of persistence, lots of testing, and learning as I go. If something seems unconventional or could be done better, that's probably why - I'm always open to learning from those with more experience!

## 💬 Feedback Welcome!

I'm always looking to improve! If you:
- Find a bug 🐛
- Have a feature suggestion 💡
- Want to contribute code 🤝
- Have general feedback or questions ❓

Please feel free to [open an issue](../../issues) or reach out. Constructive feedback helps me learn and makes these add-ons better for everyone.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant instance:

   ```
2. Navigate to the Add-on Store

## 📝 Note

These add-ons are provided as-is, and while I do my best to ensure they work correctly, please use them at your own discretion. Always back up your Home Assistant configuration before installing new add-ons.
